Toolbox for Inferring Interaction Laws from Observing Various Self-Organized Dynamics
1. Examples are used for the paper, Nonparametric inference of interaction laws in systems of agents from trajectory data, link:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06003
2. Every main example contains solver_info (used for the numerical integrator), sys_info (contains information regarding the 
whole system), obs_info (information on how to observe the dynamical system), learn_info (information on how to infer the 
interactions from the observation), and plot_info (information on how to visualize the learning results).
